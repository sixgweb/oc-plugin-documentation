# Settings

## Allow List Sharing
Allow users to set list as public/private if user has permission List Saver->Share Lists.  Public lists are visible to everyone and can only be deleted by the original author.

## Use ListSaver Name as List Export File Name
Use the ListSaver name slug for the list export file name, if a ListSaver is selected.  This setting only applies to ImportExport Controllers that enable [useList](https://docs.octobercms.com/3.x/extend/importexport/importexport-controller.html#integration-with-list-behavior) in the config_import_export.yaml

## Enabled Paths
By default, ListSaver is enabled on all ListControllers. To limit the ListSaver to specific paths, add them here by selecting an existing backend navigation item or enter your own path (backend/author/plugin/controller).
