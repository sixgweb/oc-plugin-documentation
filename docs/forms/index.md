# Forms Plugin

The Forms plugin utilizes [Attributize](/attributize/) and [Conditions](/conditions/) plugins to create frontend/backend forms.  Forms can be configured to save entries to the database, automatically purge saved entries, and throttle entries through the visitor session.

Form entry notifications are handled through the NotifyForms plugin, which integrates Forms with RainLab.Notify and provides addition Form settings.
